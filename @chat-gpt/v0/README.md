# Arkini v0 notes index

Status: ACTIVE
Updated: 2026-06-18

This folder holds Arkini v0-specific working notes, completed task logs and follow-up plans. Root `@chat-gpt/README.md` is still the current high-level working map; this folder is the v0 archive/index so the root does not become a markdown landfill with ambitions.

## Current source of truth

- Live gameplay runtime: `RuntimeGameEngineAdapter` + `GameRuntimeStore` + `useSyncExternalStore` selectors.
- Static game config: compiled/validated `GameConfig` JSON from `game/arkini`.
- Persisted save: Dexie-backed `GameSave`, validated through `GameSaveConfigSchema` and wiped on incompatibility.
- Tile interaction: generic TileEngine + Arkini drop intent mapping. Requirements are filled through DnD/merge-like interactions, not special buttons.

## Active / useful task candidates

### 1. Touch/long-press polish

Long press on game surfaces should not open native browser menus. Keep suppression scoped to board/tile surfaces so normal app UI is not wrecked for sport.

### 2. Badge/visual polish

Tile badge/level offset can be tightened toward the corner. Keep it tiny and do not redesign tile layout while pretending it is “just polish”.

## Deferred / historical notes

- `v0-effect-tick-engine-2026-06-17.md` and `v0-tick-engine-integration-readiness-2026-06-17.md` are historical architecture plans. The runtime engine path is now live.
- `v0-json-game-definition-plan-2026-06-17.md` is mostly implemented as the JSON package/compile/validate path; use it for rationale, not as a fresh TODO list.
- `v0-product-line-categories-2026-06-17.md` remains deferred until producer product-line UI actually needs authored grouping.
- `000-refactor-backlog/*` remains an epic-style backlog/archive. New small task logs can live directly in this folder when they are v0-specific.

## Selected next task

Recommended next coding task: **Touch/long-press polish**.

Reason: native browser context/callout menus on the game surface are still a small UX landmine for touch play. Scope suppression to board/tile surfaces only, not the whole app.

## Completed recent task

- `v0-product-line-input-refs-2026-06-18.md`: producer-level consumable inputs moved to standalone named input definitions referenced by product lines; line inputs fill through DnD and are stored under `save.producerInputs`.
- `v0-merge-executable-parity-2026-06-18.md`: regular combo merges now resolve from either drag direction through one executable resolver shared by runtime, DnD and item catalog detail.
- `v0-producer-board-progress-2026-06-18.md`: running producer jobs now show a subtle bottom progress bar on their board tile; future queue and blocked delivery are intentionally ignored.
- `v0-producer-blocked-delivery-2026-06-18.md`: producer output rolls once, blocked delivery persists on the job, retries without spam/reroll, keeps queue capacity occupied, and marks blocked producer tiles with a subtle danger frame.
- `v0-local-placement-planner-2026-06-18.md`: shared Manhattan `seedCell` placement planner wired into producer/stash/craft/scheduled output flow.
